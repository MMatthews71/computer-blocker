REM  FocusLock - guarded uninstall (commitment device)
REM
REM  FocusLock will NOT uninstall on a whim. Removal uses a 7-day cooldown:
REM
REM    1. Run this once. If no removal is pending, it starts the 7-day clock
REM       and exits WITHOUT removing anything - FocusLock keeps blocking.
REM    2. Come back any time after 7 full days and run it again. Only then are
REM       the background tasks, the running service, and the watchdog removed.
REM
REM  Cancel any time before the 7 days are up from the FocusLock app
REM  ("Cancel removal"), which keeps you protected.
REM
REM  The cooldown is enforced by the service, whose state file is signed - you
REM  cannot shorten the wait by editing a file or re-running this script.
